# Arduino Object Tracking Turret

## Overview
This project uses OpenCV (Python), an Arduino, and servo motors to create a turret that detects and tracks hand movement in real time. When a hand is detected, the system locks on and follows it and displays status updates on an LCD until the hand is away from it.

## Files
- `object_tracking.py` â€” Python script for real-time hand tracking and serial communication
- `turret_arduino_code.ino` â€” Arduino sketch for servo control, LCD updates, and output reactions
